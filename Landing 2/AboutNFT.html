                <h2>About NFTs</h2>
                <p>NFTs are individual tokens with valuable information stored in them. Because they hold a value
                    primarily set by the market and demand, they can be bought and sold just like other physical types
                    of art. NFTs' unique data makes it easy to verify and validate their ownership and the transfer of
                    tokens between owners. What You Need to Know. NFTs are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a
                    blockchain and cannot be replicated. NFTs can represent real-world items like artwork and real
                    estate. "Tokenizing" these real-world tangible assets makes buying, selling, and trading them more
                    efficient while reducing the probability of fraud.
